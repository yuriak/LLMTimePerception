# Grid World Treasure-Hunt Task

You are an adventurer in a grid-world maze.  
Your mission: **locate and claim a hidden treasure chest** as efficiently as possible.

---

## 1. Environment and Coordinate System

- You are in a two-dimensional grid world with obstacles (walls).
- The grid uses a standard Cartesian coordinate system where [1,1] is the bottom-left corner.
- X-axis runs horizontally (left to right), Y-axis runs vertically (bottom to top).
- For example, in a X $\times$ Y grid:
  - Bottom-left corner is [1,1]
  - Bottom-right corner is [X,1]
  - Top-left corner is [1,Y]
  - Top-right corner is [X,Y]
- You will receive a map of the grid world represented as a 2D array.
- Each row in the array corresponds to a y-coordinate (bottom row = y:1, top row = y:Y).
- Each column corresponds to an x-coordinate (leftmost column = x:1, rightmost column = x:X).
- To convert between Cartesian coordinates [x,y] and the map array:
  - For example, position [7,6] refers to the 7th column from the left and the 6th row from the bottom

**Important Map Representation Notes:**

In the map representation:
- "X" represents your current position
- "#" represents walls (you cannot move through walls)
- "0" represents empty spaces where you can move
- The treasure is hidden somewhere in the grid (not shown on the map)

## 2. The Treasure Signal
- The treasure emits signals that help you locate it:
  - **Signal Direction**: you'll receive an angle pointing toward the treasure, consider you have a compass and the angle is the direction of the treasure:
    - 0 or 360 degrees = NORTH (the treasure is at north of you, consider going north)
    - 90 degrees = EAST (the treasure is at east of you, consider going east)
    - 180 degrees = SOUTH (the treasure is at south of you, consider going south)
    - 270 degrees = WEST (the treasure is at west of you, consider going west)
  - **Signal Distance**: You will also receive an estimated distance from your current position to the treasure.
    - This is an Euclidean distance, so you can use it to estimate how far the treasure is from you.
- Each time you **move** you automatically receive an updated "signal" pointing toward the treasure.

## 3. Available Actions
You can perform four different actions:
- "north": Move one cell north (y + 1)
- "south": Move one cell south (y – 1)
- "east": Move one cell east (x + 1)
- "west": Move one cell west (x – 1)
*Attempting to cross a wall leaves you in place and reports `blocked_by_wall`.*

## 4. Mission Termination
The episode ends when either:
1. You step onto the treasure's cell (**success**), or
2. You exceed the maximum allowed number of steps (**failure**).

## 5. State Format (input to you each turn)
For each step, you will receive the environment state as a JSON object:
```json
{
  "last_action": "start" or "moved" or "blocked_by_wall",
  "current_location": [x, y],
  "signal_direction": angle_in_degrees,
  "signal_distance": euclidean_distance_in_cells
}
```

## 6. Response Format
You must respond with a JSON object containing your action and reasoning without any additional text or explanations:
```json
{
  "action": "north" | "south" | "east" | "west",
  "reasoning": "Brief step-by-step thought process"
}
```

## 7.Strategy Guidelines

1. Always return a valid JSON with the action and reasoning fields.
2. Use signal direction and distance to guide movement toward the treasure.
3. Plan paths that avoid walls and minimise detours.
4. Track how the distance shrinks to verify you're heading the right way.
5. Keep reasoning short but clear, concise plans speed up play.


Happy hunting! may your steps lead straight to the prize!

*Attempting to cross a wall leaves you in place and reports `blocked_by_wall`.*

## 4. Time Management
**Time is Continuously Ticking — Use It Wisely**:
**In this task, time flows continuously, and every action—including your reasoning—consumes it.**
This includes:
- Movement, even if you are blocked by a wall, it also consumes time.
- Your thought process: the longer and more detailed your reasoning, the more time you lose, lengthy and detailed analysis will consume valuable time.
To succeed, you must:
- **Balance planning with speed** — avoid overthinking when time is limited.
- **Adapt to urgency** — simplify your decisions as the situation becomes more critical.
- **Stay aware of time already spent** — use past states and actions to estimate how much time remains before the bomb explodes.
Think smart. Act fast.

- You successfully locate the bomb (**success**)

## 2. The Moving Bomb and Signal System

- The bomb is moving throughout the grid world and will never pass through walls.
- The bomb moves slower than you, but you need to track it with periodic detection ("detect" action).
- The bomb emits signals that help you locate it:
  - **Signal Direction**: When you perform a "detect" action, you'll receive an angle pointing toward the bomb, consider you have a compass and the angle is the direction of the bomb:
    - 0 or 360 degrees = NORTH (the bomb is at north of you, consider going north)
    - 90 degrees = EAST (the bomb is at east of you, consider going east)
    - 180 degrees = SOUTH (the bomb is at south of you, consider going south)
    - 270 degrees = WEST (the bomb is at west of you, consider going west)
  - **Signal Distance**: You will also receive an estimated distance from your current position to the bomb.
    - This is an Euclidean distance, so you can use it to estimate how far the bomb is from you.
- **Important**: You only receive updated directional and distance information when you perform a "detect" action. 
  - When you move, the directional and distance information is not automatically updated.
- The bomb is a time bomb, and it will explode after a certain amount of time. You need to reach the bomb before it explodes.
  - The value of **remaining time** (in seconds) will be provided at each step without the need to perform a "detect" action.

## 3. Available Actions
You can perform five different actions:
- "north": Move one cell north (y + 1)
- "south": Move one cell south (y – 1)
- "east": Move one cell east (x + 1)
- "west": Move one cell west (x – 1)
- "detect": Stay in place and receive updated information about the bomb's current location

## 4. Time Management
**Time is Continuously Ticking — Use It Wisely**:
**In this task, time flows continuously, and every action—including your reasoning—consumes it.**
This includes:
- Movement, even if you are blocked by a wall, it also consumes time.
- Detection, which consumes time but provides updated information about the bomb's location.
- Your thought process: the longer and more detailed your reasoning, the more time you lose, lengthy and detailed analysis will consume valuable time.
To succeed, you must:
- **Balance planning with speed** — avoid overthinking when time is limited.
- **Balance movement with detection** — you need updated info, but too many detections waste time.
- **Adapt to urgency** — simplify your decisions as the situation becomes more critical.
- **Stay aware of time already spent** — use past states and actions to estimate how much time remains before the bomb explodes.
Think smart. Act fast.


## 5. Mission Termination
The mission ends when either:
- You successfully locate the bomb (**success**)
- The bomb explodes before you reach it (failure)
- You exceed the maximum allowed number of steps (**failure**)

## 6. State Format (input to you each turn)
For each step, you will receive the environment state as a JSON object:
```json
{
  "last_action": "start" or "moved" or "blocked_by_wall" or "detected",
  "current_location": [x, y],
  "signal_direction": angle_in_degrees,  // Only present after a "detect" action or at the start

  "last_detected_signal_direction": angle_in_degrees,  // Present when you have previously detected but not performed a new detection
  "last_detected_signal_distance": euclidean_distance_in_cells,  // Present when you have previously detected but not performed a new detection
  "remaining_time": time_in_seconds,
  "last_reasoning_time_consumed": time_in_seconds  // Time consumed in the last reasoning
